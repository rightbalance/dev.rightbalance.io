To take full advantage of Serverless, we’ll need to break down the complex processes into individual steps triggered by events. An example is triggering a Lambda function when a file gets uploaded to an S3 bucket. Once the file arrives, the Lambda gets triggered to process a file and write it to a data warehouse. Doing so allows us to use AWS Lambda being able to process as many files as we want to lean on the cloud provider to do the scaling work for us.",{"type":25,"tag":34,"props":1812,"children":1813},{},[1814],{"type":25,"tag":1120,"props":1815,"children":1818},{"alt":1816,"src":1817},"Event driven programming illustration","https://images.rightbalance.io/uploads/event-driven-programming-2.svg",[],{"type":25,"tag":486,"props":1820,"children":1823},{"id":1821,"className":1822},"automatic-deployments-ci-cd",[1782],[1824],{"type":31,"value":1825},"Automatic Deployments (CI/CD)",{"type":25,"tag":34,"props":1827,"children":1828},{},[1829],{"type":31,"value":1830},"By automating away the process of deploying our code to the cloud, we enable our developers to focus on what matters most: writing code for new features.
