It’s very easy to fall into a trap of introducing a couple of manual steps in your deployment or some SQL you need to run sometimes to clean up your data. The goal is to reduce the number of manual steps engineers need to do instead of adding more manual steps. Each maintenance step you add may not seem like a lot. It’s a slippery slope that turns software engineers into maintenance engineers. We’ve seen the entire engineering team not producing any more new code and just doing some manual tasks to keep the product running.

Coding is hard and there are only so many hours in a day. So it’s best to apply our coding skills towards automating some manual work we otherwise need to do. Another issue with manual work is that it requires a context switch. Because coding requires you to deal with a lot of variables, it takes some time to get into the context (what some people call getting into the zone). Switching to a manual task, like updating some records in the database, requires you to switch your context. Then once the task is done, coming back to coding will take some time again because you need to get into another, more complicated context of coding. If you have several manual tasks spread throughout the day, you’ll find yourself not producing any meaningful code by the end of the day. That said, doing some manual work once in a while is unavoidable.
