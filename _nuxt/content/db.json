It’s a process of delivering your code continuously using an automated pipeline as opposed to doing a manual one [big bang](https://svpg.com/big-bang-releases/ \"Big bang deployment overview\") waterfall deployment.\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nMost of the software teams use a source control system like Git. We’ve several different branching strategies like [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git flow branching strategy\"). All of the strategies have one thing in common. There is a single mainline development branch. Each developer creates his/her own branch of the mainline and works independently on a feature. Once the feature is ready, the code is reviewed and merged back to the mainline.\n\n### Continuous Delivery\n\nNow that the code is merged into the mainline, we need to go through the rest of the steps like deploying it, doing QA, and eventually, pushing the new code to production to serve some real users. Each step involves some build process that has to happen to build, test, and deliver the code to the right place. This is where an automated pipeline comes into play where each step is automated following some established conventions everyone on the team follows.\n\n## Advantages of using CI/CD\n\n### Speed\n\nThe main advantage of CI/CD is the increase in velocity. Once you have the process and the pipeline in place, you’ll be able to ship your changes faster. As with any process, it’s just more efficient to do the same steps over and over again rather than shipping changes ad-hoc differently each time.

QA team knows where to get a new build to test. It’s clear how to deploy to each environment including production and how to troubleshoot some issues.\n\n### Quality\n\nCI/CD brings some automation allowing you to take advantage of automated tests, having your compiler catch bugs, and your automated deployments exercising your infrastructure. With all the automation in place, you start investing in the health of your system, getting some dividends with each test added instead of playing catchup using some manual testing. Every run of your pipeline runs hundreds (and sometimes even more) of automated tests to make sure your product is rock solid when it comes to production.\n\n### Consistency\n\nAs we all know, humans are inconsistent, and computers are great at doing the same thing over and over again. No human will be able to build, test, and deploy your changes multiple times a day consistently. Automated pipelines, when done right, always work for you. Consistency makes your compliance process easier to maintain. And while the CI server is running your pipeline, you have your developers writing some new features. Which is more fun than building and deploying anyway 😉.\n\n## Anatomy of a CI/CD Pipeline\n\nMost of the automated pipelines consist of the following major steps:\n\n**// TODO: add the CI/CD illustration**\n\n### Build\n\nWhile developers make their changes, we want to make sure the code builds into a runnable product. Here, we run a compiler and/or linter for scripting based languages to make sure we’re able to run the code.\n\n### Test\n\nThe next step is to test your code.

Most of the notifications go to slack or email. Important to note that if failures happen along the way, the pipeline notifies the developer of the failed step so the action can be taken promptly.\n\n## How You Can Implement CI/CD\n\n### Lock in Your Branching Strategy\n\nWe recommend following [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ \"Git Flow Overview\") or some variation of it. Making sure everyone follows the same process for branching makes everything easier. If you have multiple environments (like development, staging, and production) you may want to name your branches the same way so it’s easy to map the branches to the environments the code should be deployed to.\n\n### Build, Test, Deploy\n\nChances are, you either already have a way to build, test, and deploy your code. The goal here is to distill it down to a single command you can run from your terminal. If your build process involves running multiple commands, no problem, we’ll just write a build script running each step. If you don’t have automated tests, the best first step is to set up a testing framework and add it to the CI pipeline. Once tests run automatically, it’s easy to add them one by one gradually.

Worry not, each of those massive spreadsheets can be distilled down to a single command step by step.\n\n### Pipeline it\n\nNow you have all your steps in order, it’s easy to put it together into a pipeline. There are numerous technology choices starting from self-hosted options like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/ \"Jenkins Website\") all the way to some hosted solutions like [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ \"CircleCI website\") and [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/ \"Azure Pipelines - CI/CD from Azure\"). It all depends on your system and your current technology stack.

Client-side development is centered around developing client-side applications. Mobile applications, websites, desktop apps are all examples of a client-side application. When your users interact with your product, the only thing they see is your client-side user interface. That’s why building your client-side applications right is crucial to deliver an enlightening user experience.\n\n## Client-Side Application Architecture\n\nA typical client-side application consists of the following main components:\n\n**// TODO: add the diagram here**\n\n### User Interface\n\nAll visual elements like buttons, different color backgrounds, images, etc, and most of the interactions between them are your user interface. At this level, you’ll work primarily with the layout frameworks like [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) / [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/ \"Swift UI framework from Apple\") for iOS, your favorite Javascript and CSS framework for your web application like [React](https://reactjs.org/ \"React JS Framework\"), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ \"Vue JS Framework\"), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/ \"Svelte\"), etc.\n\nAll code powering your UI runs in the main thread of the application. The main thread is the thread responsible for rendering your UI. You want to be mindful of the operations you perform on the main thread. Heavy work should be offloaded to the background thread instead. This way the UI stays responsive and the users have some great user experience even if there is some heavy work happening in the background at the same time.\n\n### Networking Layer\n\nThe networking layer’s main purpose is to fetch and save the data to the API | **LINK TO API SOLUTION HERE**. This layer performs the actual network requests, parses the data coming from the API. Last but not least, it saves the parsed data into the Data Store Layer in the shape the application expects it.\n\n### Data Store\n\nThe datastore layer is responsible for storing and persisting the data on the client (either in memory or on disk). UI layer gets its data from the store as it changes. The networking layer updates the data in the store as it comes from the API. This way both the UI layer and the networking layer are abstracted and decoupled from each other and can be developed independently.\n\n[CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html \"CoreData framework\") on iOS, [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/ \"Vuex - a reactive store for Vue.js\") for Vue.js, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/ \"Store for React\") for React, are all examples of a data store for your client-side application.\n\n## Focus areas\n\nBecause your client-side applications’ main function is to interact directly with the user, the primary focus is on the following areas.\n\n### Look and Feel\n\nYour users will be using your UI every single time they interact with your product. That’s why it’s important to have a beautiful, aesthetically pleasing design for your app. When you hold the phone with your application in your hands, or when you have it on the screen of your desktop computer, you should wow over how great the look and feel is. The elements should be clearly positioned on the screen, the user should be able to navigate to each part of the app effortlessly. Adding subtle animations to some UI elements where needed makes the application UI really pop.\n\n### Performance\n\nYour client-side application runs on a device with some limited resources. That’s why the performance is so important because you don’t have the infinitely scalable capacity like you have on the backend. The key here is to offload all heavy work from the main thread to the background thread. Being mindful of your memory usage and your disk usage goes a long way.\n\n### Resiliency\n\nYour backend server is always plugged into the outlet and has access to the Internet. Unfortunately, it’s not the case with client-side devices. Your user's phone or a laptop can lose Internet connectivity at any time, run out of a battery, or even run out of memory since the capacity is limited. Client-side operating systems are very aggressive with freeing up precious resources. On Android or iOS, your app can be just killed by the operating system at any time when your app is in the background. In addition to it, your app should never crash at all costs. An app crash has a massively negative impact on your user growth and retention. While implementing your features on the client, lean on the safe side, write a lot of safeguards and null checks. Save your data locally or on the server so you can pick up where you left off in case the user quits the app and opens it at a later time.\n\n## Automated Testing and CI/CD\n\nWriting tests on the client is very straightforward at the networking level. You’ll be able to write some good unit tests which are fast to execute. On another hand, UI testing is more complicated, less flexible, and that’s where you get the most coverage and benefit. That’s why we recommend writing most of the unit tests at the networking level and writing a few UI tests for the major flows in the app. While writing UI tests, it’s important to keep in mind that some elements can appear on the screen with some delays. In addition to it, it’s best to mock the network calls to avoid some unexpected test failures due to network latency.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that there are many variations of client devices, browsers, and operating systems. We recommend running your automated and manual tests on the farm of devices. [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/ \"AWS Device Farm overview\"), [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab \"Firebase Test Lab page\"), [Cross Browser Testing](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/ \"Cross Browser Testing Page\"), or [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/ \"Browser Stack page\") are all great solutions you can use to solve this problem.\n\nYour CI/CD pipeline should be capable of testing and building your apps for testing and distribution. We recommend [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/ \"TestFlight overview\") for iOS, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution \"Firebase page\") for Android. For your web and desktop applications, you can use your internal test environment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see, client-side development is a different beast from your backend or infrastructure development.

You deploy your code and your cloud provider manages the servers for you under the hood. It allows you to focus on your code minimizing the amount of effort spent on the infrastructure.\n\n## Why Serverless Matters\n\n### Pay per use\n\nNo need to pay for idle servers. With Serverless, you only pay for the time it takes to run your application. If you aren’t using your system, you don’t incur any runtime costs. It’s ideal for your development, staging, and QA environments which aren’t used 24/7.\n\n### All major cloud providers support Serverless\n\n[Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), [Google GCP](https://cloud.google.com/serverless), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless/), and many more providers support Serverless technology. Most of them continue to integrate Serverless further into more of their products. We’re already seeing [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) database and [Fargate Container](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) engine following the same Serverless principles of paying for only when the resources are used. Serverless is entering the mainstream phase now. There are plenty of resources and libraries online to help you.\n\nTODO: add the images of cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). All of them have the branded images free for use downloadable on their sites.\n\n### Infinitely Scalable\n\nServerless resources grow and shrink automatically with your demand. More Serverless resources are spawned up when more requests are coming. If there are no requests at all, no resources are running.\n\n### Be At the Forefront of Technology\n\nRunning on your own hardware is complicated and unnecessary (unless you’re at a scale of Google or Amazon), so as running on dedicated virtualized servers (like [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)). Over the next 5 years, Serverless will become the norm and a default choice for new development. Working with new technology is exciting for you and your team! Don’t miss the opportunity to be ahead of the game instead of playing catch up.\n\n## Business Problems Serverless Solves\n\n### Power your Websites, Mobile Apps, and IoT Devices\n\nServerless functions plugs in directly into your API Gateway or GraphQL endpoints. This means they can power your client applications like mobile apps, websites, IoT devices, and the rest of the backend microservices.\n\n### Deliver relevant data to stakeholders\n\nIn our day and age, having access to the relevant data is everything. It’s very straightforward to connect your serverless function to a queue, a pub-sub system, a database or even your file storage bucket. In the case of AWS, all of the major data services like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) all support the ability to trigger a serverless function to take the data that just arrived, transform it and deliver it to some relevant parties. No need to build some brutal long-running ETL jobs introducing some update delays. Process the data as it comes in, and deliver it to your data warehouse close to real-time.\n\n### Reduce Infrastructure Cost\n\nNo need to pay for your servers sitting around doing no work, right? Same for your database, if it’s not being used in your QA environment overnight, why pay for it? By moving more and more resources to Serverless, you reduce your costs and make your CFO happy 💸\n\n### Increase Development Velocity\n\nBusiness opportunities come and go quickly. Being able to develop your software fast, deploy it, and have it run automatically is key for growing your business. Serverless technology allows you to do exactly that. Just focus on your features and let your cloud provider take care of the infrastructure for you.\n\n### Handle Traffic Spikes Seamlessly\n\nEver got a notification about your servers going down because of a marketing campaign bringing more traffic? With a well-architected Serverless system, with all bottlenecks removed (or moved to Serverless) you’ll be able to support any unexpected spike in traffic. With more traffic coming to the system, more serverless functions are spawned up to support the increasing demand. And when the traffic is tailing off, fewer serverless functions are invoked to keep your system cost-effective.\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\" class=\"heading\">Solution</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"strong-architecture\" class=\"subheading\">Strong Architecture</h3>\n\nPutting together some solid architecture goes a long way.
