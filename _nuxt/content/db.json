With a fully static website, it’s an infinitely scalable and robust solution. We’re constantly adding new content on the site, promoting the new content on socials, and collaborating with some technology-focused websites in the industry.\n\nIn today’s day and age, the Internet brings the power of reaching millions of people on the web. To do so effectively, your website needs to stand out. It needs to be built with the latest technologies and best practices.

We developed a fully custom front end site with Vue.js and Nuxt. Allowing us to fine-tune the website for the best SEO, showing perfectly in each major browser on all major devices like phones, desktops, and tablets. For the contact form, we’re making a secure call over HTTPS to our AWS ApiGateway connected to SNS. Again, by minimizing the dependency on the backend, we increase the overall resilience and scalability of the site. Once the site is built, we deploy all static assets on a CDN which makes it available to everyone across the globe. Using a CDN allows our users to access the site from their local content delivery network decreasing the loading speed of the entire site to the minimum.  We didn’t stop there and added a git powered CMS Forestry.io allowing us to write content effortlessly on the site without introducing the backend and the database like WordPress. In addition to it, it allows us to keep all our content as simple markdown documents checked in into Git version control. We can easily see what’s changed and when. Using VuePress as a content site engine brings some great navigation out of the box. Every file is compiled into some plain and simple HTML, CSS with a little Javascript, no heavy SPA. It loads instantly in your browser and web crawlers love it and understand it. It’s amazing!"},{"name":"UX","description":"The designs were looking great and we didn’t stop there. We wanted each page to communicate the idea behind it. That’s where we brought in a professional computer graphics animator to animate each illustration. The plexus started moving on the first page, the picture of the stack started to expand as you scroll through it, combined with the animation of the futuristic human head and the diamond it brought this unique feel and experience. At the last slide, we wanted to be creative, casually inviting a user to get a coffee, beer or some beverage to talk about their project and still maintaining the futuristic look and feel. That’s where we created some custom drawn images of each drink. Each image has an active version. This way we made each drink a button allowing a user to select their drink."},{"name":"Design","description":"Right Balance and a creative agency Imprint joined forces to bring some magical experience to the users. After the project kickoff, we were clear on the messaging and the overall futuristic feel of the site. Imprint is amazing at delivering some creative ideas and solutions. We went through several iterations of the designs arriving at the final copy, colors, fonts, and illustrations."}]},"problem":{"quote":"","text":"Each business is unique. It has a unique set of beliefs which makes it different from any other business. To showcase its authentic look and feel, a regular templated website like Squarespace or Wix is not enough.

However, a templated solution for the marketing website has some drawbacks:","items":[{"name":"Boring","description":"One of the unique value propositions of Right Balance is bringing some breakthrough innovation.

In fact, that’s what we recommend some of our clients to do when uniqueness is not a requirement and time and the budget are.
